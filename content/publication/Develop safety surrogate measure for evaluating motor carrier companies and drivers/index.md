abstract: The risk of accidents of commercial vehicles is higher than that of ordinary vehicles. Traffic fatalities per registered vehicles are 3.8 times higher than in commercial vehicles than ordinary vehicles in 2016. Because of the high severity of accidents, there should be a lot of effort to reduce accidents and manage traffic safety of motor carrier companies. So far, safety assessments for commercial vehicles have been evaluated according to the frequency and the severity of accidents. This approach has several problems. First, the accident can not be preemptively prevented because it is based on the post evaluation of the accident. Second, it is difficult to provide consulting or action guidelines because it is impossible to determine what factors caused traffic accidents. With the recent development of data collection technology, not only traffic accident information, but also the various characteristics of motor carrier companies and drivers such as vehicle driving record, dangerous driving behavior, law violation information are collected. Therefore, this study aims to develop a new safety surrogate measure based on various characteristics of motor carrier companies and drivers.
